The enemy is advancing rapidly, and I fear that we may not be able to hold our position much longer. 
If we are overrun, destroy the codebook and all equipment. "No one must know," I repeat, "no one must know."
We, therefore, must send this message to our allies: They are to gather their forces and make a final stand. 
Should I fail to return, know that I fought bravely until the end—holding onto hope for our future—Hope remains with us all—United we stand as one.
